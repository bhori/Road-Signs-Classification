# Road-Signs-Classification  
This project is designed to produce a classification model for road signs.  
For this purpose, I used a number of different models from simple to complicated in order to examine the differences and the accuracy percentages between the models.  
List of models I used in the project:  
* [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/bhori/Road-Signs-Classification/blob/master/simple_logistic_regression.py)  
* [Neural network with one hidden layer of neurons](https://github.com/bhori/Road-Signs-Classification/blob/master/NN_oneHiddenLayer.py)  
* [Neural network with two hidden layers of neurons](https://github.com/bhori/Road-Signs-Classification/blob/master/NN_twoHiddenLayers.py)  
* [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/bhori/Road-Signs-Classification/blob/master/CNN.py) (with TensorFlow 1)  
* [Convolutional Neural Network](https://github.com/bhori/Road-Signs-Classification/blob/master/CNN_tf2.py) (with TensorFlow 2)
